          Financial markets are complex because they are associated with non-linear models. Therefore, incorporating artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, into market prediction and trend analysis is an important step and 
          reshaping global financial markets. Machine learning offers the ability to process massive amounts of data at incredible speeds. It opens up a new chapter in the financial industry by being able to train models and provide detailed and 
          accurate information that was previously not possible. This paper will focus on real-world data processing, looking at how to apply supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning architectures like LSTM, and natural language processing techniques 
          are applied to structured and unstructured financial data. It also explores the entire machine learning pipeline for time series forecasting, highlights tools used in the industry, and discusses ethical concerns around algorithmic trading.

          With the continuous development of science and technology, many fields have entered a new page, including the financial industry. Thanks to the help of artificial intelligence (AI), investors have new opportunities for predicting market trends and strategic investments. 
          Machine learning models, including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and predictive analytics, are used to analyze, predict, and forecast real-time financial data to optimize trading decisions, performance measurement, and customer service. 
          Applying machine learning in stock market trend prediction improves prediction efficiency, and makes financial transactions safer. Moreover, this topic addresses the concern related to algorithmic bias and market manipulation. 
          The proposal also considers the ethical issues surrounding financial decision-making based on AI and its impact on human investment strategies. By providing both advantages and limitations of AI in finance, 
          this topic will show a comprehensive and objective view of how machine learning is reshaping the financial sector.

        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom component="div" style={{ fontSize: '1.25rem', lineHeight: '1.6', textAlign: 'left' }}>
          Financial markets generate a wide variety of data types, each critical for building predictive models. Structured data includes traditional financial metrics such as OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close), quantitative data (such as prices, volumes, technical indicators, or revenue figures) and qualitative data (such as dates, names, addresses and credit card numbers). 
          This data is cleanly organized and easily processed by machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, unstructured data have no clear format, and it can contain both textual and non-textual data and both qualitative (news articles, social media posts, and analyst reports) and quantitative (figures embedded in text) data [4].

            The right table displays intraday data at 1-minute intervals on May 9, 2025, showing the same key metrics. These datasets are sorted in descending order to show the latest entries at the top. <br />
            Financial market forecasting is time-sensitive and influenced by unpredictable factors like earnings reports, global events, and investor behavior. Since financial data is dynamic and multidimensional, models must account for numerous indicators and sentiment signals. 
            The inconsistency and imbalance in the data make accurate prediction more challenging. Therefore, processing data over time will improve model predictive forecasting [1].

            <strong>Deep learning</strong> models have emerged as effective tools for financial forecasting, especially dealing with complex and high-dimensional data such as sequential stock prices or textual financial news. However, their practical implementation often requires extensive tuning and optimization - more so than simpler models like decision trees or random forests.

            <strong>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</strong> are designed to process sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs, especially those that use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. They are well suited to modeling sequential data and long-term dependencies. Examples are stock price forecasting or trading signal analysis. LSTMs are particularly effective for financial time series data, which includes past trends that influence future movements. Their architecture allows them to retain and update past information over time, making them effective for tasks such as natural language processing [3].

        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom component="div" style={{ fontSize: '1.25rem', lineHeight: '1.6', textAlign: 'left' }}>
          Time-series forecasting is all about using historical data to predict future values. In finance, this often involves predicting stock prices, or trading volumes. The forecasting pipeline typically includes steps such as data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (using ARIMA, LSTM, or other models), and evaluation [3]. <br />
          <strong>Example the time series forecasting using LSTM for predicting stock prices:</strong>
          The problem is to predict the stock price for tomorrow based on recent history. The input will be the last 30 days of closing prices for daily predicting and 60 minutes for 1-minute predicting. The model is LSTM which can remember trends over those 30 days. The output is a single number - tomorrowâ€™s predicted price and next minute predicted price. <br />
          Figure 3 shows the architecture of the LSTM model built using Keras. The model consists of two stacked LSTM layers with dropout for regularization and a final dense output layer. It is compiled using the Adam optimizer with mean square error (MSE) as the loss function and mean absolute error (MAE) as a performance metric. The model is designed to capture sequential patterns in historical stock price data.
